# AI Studio History Cleaner

A lightweight, browser-based tool to parse and clean up exported chat history JSON files from Google AI Studio. It extracts the conversation into a clean, readable Markdown format, with optional support for including "Thinking" (Reasoning) blocks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easily upload multiple JSON export files at once.
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically handles different JSON structures (`chunks`, `parts`, etc.) found in AI Studio exports.
- **Reasoning Toggle**: Choose whether to include or hide the internal "Thinking" blocks from the model.
- **Markdown Preview**: View the generated Markdown directly in the browser.
- **One-Click Copy/Download**: Copy the result to your clipboard or download it as a `.md` file.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Runs entirely in the browser using a single HTML file. No backend or build step required.
